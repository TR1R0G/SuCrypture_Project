# SuCrypture_Project

Collaboration with Selami Doğan Akansu.

Firstly, in order to reduce the data stored in the Blockchain, only links that refer to a creature and store the information about it, will be tokenized. Therefore gas tokenization part will be integrated into the project with ERC721 Non-Fungible Token Standard. While referring to a creature or querying it, passing a token-id (in this case it’s the creature id) will be enough to get information as a return. In addition to this, since running a smart contract to claim a creature requires location info, the GPS location of the user will be passed to the contract as a concatenated string of longitude and latitude values. However, the problem of this is the difficulty of getting to the exact location. Therefore, the last two digits of the location values will be deleted so that the new values are going to refer to an area rather than a single point. These location values later will be hashed after the concatenation process and will be compared to see if they are equal. If so, the smart contract will be available to run. The creation and ownership of a creature will be implemented with the help of ERC721 Standard, which has the required functions such as: ownerOf(), approve(), transfer(), transferFrom().

As it is already stated, the metadata that describes a creature should be stored in servers. To be able to get any description, The function: function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId) public view virtual override returns will be utilized. The tokenURI function in the metadata extension which is implemented in ERC721 makes it possible to get data with the only input tokenId and returns a result JSON format. From there on it is easier to process the returning results. For the sake of security, the functions will get the “payable” keyword which is absent in the previous versions of Solidity. In that way transactions that don’t require any payment won’t be payable any more. Another major issue is GPS Spoofing that adversaries might abuse too. Normally, one could argue that it is better to ask for a Proof of Location service but the downside is that it will definitely be costly. Since this is not a commercial Full Stack project, Proof of Location is not going to be integrated in. Other techniques will be utilized such as LAN Reporting, WAN Reporting, etc. 

The flowchart of the possible operations are shown below in the picture:
